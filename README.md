>I've got a tabbed navigation bar where I'd like the open tab to have a shadow to set it apart from the other tabs. I'd also like the whole tab section to have a single shadow (see bottom horizontal line) going up, shading the bottom of all tabs except for the open one.

I'm going to use CSS3's box-shadow property to do it, but I can't figure out a way to shade only the parts I want.<https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1429605/creating-a-css3-box-shadow-on-all-sides-but-one>

```
.shadow1 {
  margin: 40px;
  background-color: rgb(68,68,68); /* Needed for IE */
  box-shadow: 5px 5px 5px rgb(68 68 68 / 0.6);
  filter: progid:DXImageTransform.Microsoft.Blur(PixelRadius=3,MakeShadow=true,ShadowOpacity=0.30);
  -ms-filter: "progid:DXImageTransform.Microsoft.Blur(PixelRadius=3,MakeShadow=true,ShadowOpacity=0.30)";
  zoom: 1;
}
```
